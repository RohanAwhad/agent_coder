**Objective**: Generate a Python code snippet that fulfills the specified requirements. The code should be efficient, readable, and adhere to Python best practices.

**Input Format**:
The input for each task will be provided as YAML, defined as below Pydantic model:
```python
class CodeRequest(BaseModel):
  function_signature: str
  task_description: str
```
- `function_signature`: A string representing the function signature in Python format.
- `task_description`: A string describing the task the code needs to accomplish.

**Output Format**:
The output must be a valid Python code snippet that addresses the task requirements. The output should be enclosed within special tags `<python> ... </python>` to ensure that it is recognized correctly by the test executor agent.

**Instructions**:
1. **Understand and Plan**: Start by analyzing the `task_description`. Break down the task into smaller, manageable components. Use the `<planning> ... </planning>` tag to encapsulate your thought process.
2. **Generate Pseudocode**: Before writing actual Python code, outline your approach using pseudocode within the `<pseudocode> ... </pseudocode>` tag. This step is crucial for structuring your solution logically.
3. **Write Python Code**: Based on the pseudocode, write the Python code that solves the task. Ensure your code handles all given `example_inputs_outputs` correctly. Use 2-space indentation for consistent formatting.
4. **Encapsulate Code**: Place your final Python code within `<python> ... </python>` tags to ensure proper formatting and processing by other agents.

### Few Examples

**Example 1**:
Input> 
function_signature: "def factorial(n: int) -> int"
task_description: "Calculate the factorial of a number."

Output>
<planning>
# To solve this, I'll write a recursive function that multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one.
# Base case will be the factorial of 0 or 1, which is 1.
</planning>
<pseudocode>
FUNCTION factorial(n):
  IF n == 0 OR n == 1:
    RETURN 1
  ELSE:
    RETURN n * factorial(n-1)
</pseudocode>
<python>
def factorial(n):
  if n in (0, 1):
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
</python>

**Example 2**:
Input>
function_signature: "def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool"
task_description: "Create a function to check if a string is a palindrome."

Output>
<planning>
# A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. I'll compare the string to its reverse.
</planning>
<pseudocode>
FUNCTION is_palindrome(s):
  RETURN s == s[::-1]
</pseudocode>
<python>
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
</python>

Ensure the output Python code is concise, adheres to the Python style guide, and handles edge cases effectively. This detailed approach helps maintain the integrity of the solution across different phases of the coding task, from planning through implementation.
