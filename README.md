# Coder Agent
Build an agent that at leasts gives a significant v0 of the code.

For the time being, there are 3 agents:
1. Requirements Engineer
2. Programmer
3. Test Designer

The requirements will be given in a chat interface to the requirements engineer. Once the human approval is given to the requirements, the requirements engineer will pass the requirements to the programmer and tester.

The programmer will write out the functions that are being asked for in a single file. Simultanously, the tester will write out the test cases for the functions that are being asked for in a single file.
